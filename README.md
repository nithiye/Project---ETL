# Project-ETL
Extract. Transform. Load

###Extraction
We used 3 datasets from the public platform of Inside Airbnb website. 

The sources for our dataset are as follows:
http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html
http://insideairbnb.com/seattle/

Our dataset is as follows:
1)	Listings.csv
2)	Calendar.csv
3)	Reviews.csv

###Transformation
Our first steps in cleaning up the datasets involved figuring out which variables were not relevant and filtering those out using Pandas (Jupyter Notebook).

###Load
The last step was to transfer our final output into a Database. We created an airbnb database and respective tables to match the columns from the final Pandaâ€™s Data Frame using MYSQL and then connected to the database using SQLAlchemy and loaded the result.
